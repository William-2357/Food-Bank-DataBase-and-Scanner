# Push Files to GitHub

The new files have been committed locally but need to be pushed to GitHub. You need to authenticate with GitHub first.

## Option 1: Using SSH (Recommended)

If you have SSH keys set up with GitHub:

```bash
# Change remote to use SSH
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:William-2357/Food-Bank-DataBase-and-Scanner.git

# Push to GitHub
git push origin master
```

## Option 2: Using GitHub Personal Access Token

1. **Generate a Personal Access Token**:
   - Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   - Click "Generate new token (classic)"
   - Select scopes: `repo` (all of it)
   - Click "Generate token"
   - **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

2. **Push using the token**:
   ```bash
   git push https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/William-2357/Food-Bank-DataBase-and-Scanner.git master
   ```
   (Replace `YOUR_TOKEN` with your actual token)

## Option 3: Using GitHub CLI

If you have GitHub CLI installed:

```bash
gh auth login
git push origin master
```
